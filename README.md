## Description
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on sequence modeling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The code is divided into three main parts:

### **1. Simple Neural Network for Arithmetic Sequences**
- Implements a small neural network with 4 neurons.
- Trains the network to predict the next number in an arithmetic sequence.
- Demonstrates how RNNs utilize past values for predictions.

### **2. Expanding the Model for Complex Sequences**
- Increases the network size to 8 neurons.
- Trains on a more complex dataset containing various arithmetic sequences.
- Highlights the limitations of basic RNN architectures.

### **3. Implementing a GRU from Scratch**
- Implements a custom Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model.
- Trains the GRU on the MNIST dataset for sequence classification.
- Compares performance against PyTorchâ€™s built-in GRU model.
